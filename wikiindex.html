				<div class="left-div-header">Overview of Life</div>
				<div class="left-div">
				Giovanna Vartuli was born on August 8, 1998 in Greenwich, Connecticut. Her family later moved to Centennial, Colorado where she would spend her life growing up. When she was young, she spent most of her time hanging out with her siblings, Michael (older brother) and Julia (younger sister), and hanging out in her neighborhood with other people that she knew. She also spent quite a lot of time doing things that she enjoyed, like reading and making crafts.
<br>
<br>
Giovanna went to Franklin Elementary School, where she really began to understand her love of art, reading, and writing. She also met her first long lasting and best friend, Abby Rictor, in the third grade, when they were both pushed into partnering up for a project. After Franklin, she went to Powell Middle School.
<br>
<br>
At Arapahoe High School, Giovanna began to discover what she was good at, as well as what she was passionate about in the long run. She got a job working as a Courtesy Clerk at her local King Soopers market, learning how to navigate social situations and work hard in the process. She also met two of her closest friends in her first two years at Arapahoe: Graham Shapley and Jacob Hirschhorn.
<br>
<br>
Giovanna joined the Drama Club, helping to put on plays and musicals all through her years in high school. By her Senior year, she had become the Publicity Crew Chief for her last two productions, and had designed a poster for one of the musicals. She also discovered her true love of art, taking classes like watercolor and jewelry, and eventually even taking the first ever Graphic Design class put on by the school. Once she realized that her love of art could be turned into a real career, she began to think about what she might want to major in in college, eventually landing on Graphic Design.
<br>
<br>
After touring a few in-state and out-of-state universities, Giovanna landed on Colorado State University as her choice of school, as she wanted to go to a school that was relatively large and close enough to her family that she could visit whenever she wanted, but far enough away that they wouldn’t visit too frequently. She began to work towards her Bachelor of Arts Degree, taking on a lot more art classes than in high school. Eventually, she got a job working as a night designer for The Rocky Mountain Collegian, CSU’s school newspaper.
